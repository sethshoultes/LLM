### Completed Tasks
- All tasks in section 1: Core Infrastructure (1.1.1 - 1.2.8)
- All tasks in section 2: RAG System Refactoring (2.1.1 - 2.3.7)
- All tasks in section 3: Web Interface and API (3.1.1 - 3.3.7)
- Most tasks in section 4: Integration and Testing (4.1.1 - 4.1.3, 4.2.1 - 4.2.4, 4.3.1)

## Current Focus
Final Cleanup and Verification (section 4.3):
- Writing remaining documentation
- Cleaning up imports and dependencies
- Running final linting and code quality checks
- Verifying against PRD requirements

## Next Steps
1. Clean up imports and dependencies (task 4.3.3)
2. Run final linting and code quality checks (task 4.3.4)
3. Final verification against PRD requirements (task 4.3.5)

## Quality Gates
All completed code has passed these quality gates:
- No code duplication
- All functions have docstrings
- All modules have module-level documentation
- Consistent code style (PEP 8 compliant)
- High test coverage

## Important Reminders
1. **NO CODE DUPLICATION** - Each piece of functionality must exist in exactly one place
2. **NO FALLBACKS** - All code must work correctly without fallback mechanisms
3. **NO LEGACY SUPPORT** - Old implementations must be completely replaced
4. **CLEAN ARCHITECTURE** - Maintain proper separation of concerns
5. **THOROUGH TESTING** - All code must be thoroughly tested
6. **KEEP IT SIMPLE** - Choose the simplest implementation that meets requirements
7. **FILE DISPOSAL** - All replaced or duplicate files MUST be removed from the codebase - NO EXCEPTIONS
