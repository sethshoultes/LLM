- Created component-based UI system with standardized class hierarchy
- Developed asset management with cache busting and URL generation
- Implemented bundler for CSS/JS optimization
- Created new handlers for template rendering and static assets
- Added template middleware for common context variables
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests for all template components

### API Standardization
- Created controller-based architecture for RAG API
- Implemented standardized response formatting
- Created schema definitions with Pydantic for API validation
- Developed Flask-compatible routes using the controller system
- Implemented bridge for compatibility with existing code

### Completed Tasks
- All tasks in section 1: Core Infrastructure (1.1.1 - 1.2.8)
- All tasks in section 2: RAG System Refactoring (2.1.1 - 2.3.7)
- All tasks in section 3: Web Interface and API (3.1.1 - 3.3.7)
- All tasks in section 4: Integration and Testing (4.1.1 - 4.1.3, 4.2.1 - 4.2.4, 4.3.1 - 4.3.5)

## Current Focus
Final Cleanup and Verification (section 4.3):
- ✅ Running final linting and code quality checks
- ✅ Verifying against PRD requirements

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Run final linting and code quality checks (task 4.3.4)
2. ✅ Final verification against PRD requirements (task 4.3.5)

## Recently Completed
- Final verification against PRD requirements (task 4.3.5)
  - Verified implementation against PRD requirements
  - Checked compliance with core principles
  - Fixed duplicate API extensions files
  - Validated template system implementation
  - Confirmed proper RAG system integration
  - Verified centralized configuration system
  - Updated status documentation to mark completion

- Run final linting and code quality checks (task 4.3.4)
  - Created linting configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg)
  - Implemented code_quality.py script to run multiple linting tools
  - Developed fix_unused_imports.py to automatically handle F401 warnings
  - Fixed TYPE_CHECKING blocks in multiple files
  - Removed resource fork files causing syntax errors
  - Fixed unused imports across the codebase
  - Made all modules compliant with PEP8 standards

- Clean up imports and dependencies (task 4.3.3)
  - Created dependency_analyzer.py tool for analyzing imports
  - Fixed circular dependencies between modules
  - Standardized import formats across the codebase
  - Removed unused imports in various files
  - Added missing imports to fix import errors
  - All modules now import and work together without errors

## Quality Gates
All completed code has passed these quality gates:
- No code duplication
- All functions have docstrings
- All modules have module-level documentation
- Consistent code style (PEP 8 compliant)
- High test coverage

## Important Reminders
1. **NO CODE DUPLICATION** - Each piece of functionality must exist in exactly one place
2. **NO FALLBACKS** - All code must work correctly without fallback mechanisms
3. **NO LEGACY SUPPORT** - Old implementations must be completely replaced
4. **CLEAN ARCHITECTURE** - Maintain proper separation of concerns
5. **THOROUGH TESTING** - All code must be thoroughly tested
6. **KEEP IT SIMPLE** - Choose the simplest implementation that meets requirements
7. **FILE DISPOSAL** - All replaced or duplicate files MUST be removed from the codebase - NO EXCEPTIONS
