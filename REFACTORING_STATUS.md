- **Phase 2 (RAG System)**: 100% complete
- **Phase 3 (Web Interface and API)**: 77% complete
- **Phase 4 (Integration and Testing)**: 42% complete

## Recent Completions

### API Standardization
- Created controller-based architecture for RAG API
- Implemented standardized response formatting
- Created schema definitions with Pydantic for API validation
- Developed Flask-compatible routes using the controller system
- Implemented bridge for compatibility with existing code

### Template System Enhancement (In Progress)
- Task 3.3.1: Create templates/ subpackage structure (Completed)
- Task 3.3.2: Implement engine.py with template rendering (Completed) 
- Task 3.3.3: Create components.py for component-based UI (Completed)
- Task 3.3.4: Implement assets.py for asset management (Completed)
- Task 3.3.5: Create bundler.py for JS/CSS bundling (Completed)
- Task 3.3.6: Refactor template handling in server code (Not Started)
- Task 3.3.7: Write unit tests for template system (Not Started)

## Current Focus
Completing Template System Enhancement (section 3.3):
- Implemented modern Jinja2-based template engine with caching
- Created component-based UI system with standardized rendering
- Developed asset management with cache busting and URL generation
- Implemented bundler for CSS/JS optimization
- Next: Integrating with server code and writing tests

## Next Steps
1. Complete final tasks in Template System Enhancement
   - Task 3.3.6: Refactor template handling in server code
   - Task 3.3.7: Write unit tests for template system
2. Create integration tests for web + api components (task 4.1.3)
3. Complete end-to-end system tests (task 4.1.4)
4. Create documentation and conduct final cleanup

## Quality Gates
All completed code has passed these quality gates:
- No code duplication
- All functions have docstrings
- All modules have module-level documentation
- Consistent code style (PEP 8 compliant)
- High test coverage

## Important Reminders
1. **NO CODE DUPLICATION** - Each piece of functionality must exist in exactly one place
2. **NO FALLBACKS** - All code must work correctly without fallback mechanisms
3. **NO LEGACY SUPPORT** - Old implementations must be completely replaced
4. **CLEAN ARCHITECTURE** - Maintain proper separation of concerns
5. **THOROUGH TESTING** - All code must be thoroughly tested
6. **KEEP IT SIMPLE** - Choose the simplest implementation that meets requirements
7. **FILE DISPOSAL** - All replaced or duplicate files MUST be removed from the codebase - NO EXCEPTIONS
