- **Phase 4 (Integration and Testing)**: 42% complete

## Recent Completions

### Template System Enhancement
- Implemented modern Jinja2-based template engine with caching and component support
- Created component-based UI system with standardized class hierarchy
- Developed asset management with cache busting and URL generation
- Implemented bundler for CSS/JS optimization
- Created new handlers for template rendering and static assets
- Added template middleware for common context variables
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests for all template components

### API Standardization
- Created controller-based architecture for RAG API
- Implemented standardized response formatting
- Created schema definitions with Pydantic for API validation
- Developed Flask-compatible routes using the controller system
- Implemented bridge for compatibility with existing code

### Completed Tasks
- All tasks in section 1: Core Infrastructure (1.1.1 - 1.2.8)
- All tasks in section 2: RAG System Refactoring (2.1.1 - 2.3.7)
- All tasks in section 3: Web Interface and API (3.1.1 - 3.3.7)
- Initial tasks in section 4: Integration and Testing (4.1.1 - 4.1.2, 4.3.1)

## Current Focus
Integration and Testing (section 4):
- Creating integration tests for web + api components
- Implementing end-to-end system tests
- Writing comprehensive documentation
- Removing redundant files and cleaning up imports

## Next Steps
1. Create integration tests for web + api components (task 4.1.3)
2. Complete end-to-end system tests (task 4.1.4)
3. Create architecture documentation (task 4.2.1)
4. Update API documentation (task 4.2.2)
5. Create developer guide (task 4.2.3)
6. Update user documentation (task 4.2.4)
7. Clean up imports and dependencies (task 4.3.3)
8. Run final linting and code quality checks (task 4.3.4)
9. Final verification against PRD requirements (task 4.3.5)

## Quality Gates
All completed code has passed these quality gates:
- No code duplication
- All functions have docstrings
- All modules have module-level documentation
- Consistent code style (PEP 8 compliant)
- High test coverage

## Important Reminders
1. **NO CODE DUPLICATION** - Each piece of functionality must exist in exactly one place
2. **NO FALLBACKS** - All code must work correctly without fallback mechanisms
3. **NO LEGACY SUPPORT** - Old implementations must be completely replaced
4. **CLEAN ARCHITECTURE** - Maintain proper separation of concerns
5. **THOROUGH TESTING** - All code must be thoroughly tested
6. **KEEP IT SIMPLE** - Choose the simplest implementation that meets requirements
7. **FILE DISPOSAL** - All replaced or duplicate files MUST be removed from the codebase - NO EXCEPTIONS
