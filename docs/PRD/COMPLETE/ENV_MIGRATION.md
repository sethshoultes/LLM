# Python Environment Migration

## Overview

In April/May 2025, the system's Python environment was consolidated to use a single environment:
`/Volumes/LLM/LLM-MODELS/tools/python/llm_env_new/`

## Changes Made

1. Updated the Raspberry Pi activation script to use the new environment:
   ```bash
   # /Volumes/LLM/LLM-MODELS/tools/scripts/activate_pi.sh
   #!/bin/bash
   source "$(dirname "$0")/../python/llm_env_new/bin/activate"
   ```

2. Updated documentation to reflect the current environment path:
   - Modified `/Volumes/LLM/docs/PRD/STRUCTURE.md` to reference the correct environment path

## Environment Comparison

Both environments were similar with the following characteristics:

### Similarities
- Python 3.13.1
- Core packages for LLM operation:
  - llama_cpp_python 0.3.8
  - transformers 4.51.3
  - numpy 2.2.5

### Differences
- `llm_env_new` is smaller (2.0GB vs 2.3GB)
- `llm_env_new` has fewer packages (101 vs 131)
- `llm_env_new` has newer versions of some key libraries (requests, urllib3)
- `llm_env_new` does not include Flask and related dependencies

## Next Steps

The original environment (`llm_env`) can be safely removed to save space if desired. All system components now point to the `llm_env_new` environment.

## Verification

To verify the change, run the system with both Mac and Raspberry Pi paths and ensure they load correctly:

```bash
# Mac verification
./llm.sh

# Raspberry Pi verification (when on Pi hardware)
./llm.sh
```

Both should now use the same Python environment.
