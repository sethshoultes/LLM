# System Refactoring Taskmaster

## Overview

This taskmaster document serves as the central tracking system for the implementation of the [System Refactoring PRD](/Volumes/LLM/docs/PRD/COMPLETE/SYSTEM_REFACTORING_PRD.md). All development must strictly adhere to:

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Zero code duplication will be tolerated
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - Simplest possible implementation is required
- **Clean Architecture** - Proper separation of concerns and layered design
- **No Fallbacks** - All code must work correctly without fallback mechanisms
- **No Legacy Support** - Old implementations must be completely replaced
- **No File Duplication** - Each functionality must exist in exactly one file

As this is an unreleased product, it must function cleanly out of the box with no legacy code, workarounds, or duplications.

## Implementation Progress Tracking

**Update frequency:** Progress must be updated at the completion of each task.  
**Priority:** Tasks must be completed in the specified order within each phase.

## Quality Gates

All code must pass these quality gates before being considered complete:

1. **Code Quality**
   - No code duplication (verified with linting tools)
   - All functions have docstrings
   - All modules have module-level documentation
   - Consistent code style (PEP 8 compliant)
   - No unused imports or variables

2. **Test Coverage**
   - 90%+ unit test coverage for core modules
   - 80%+ unit test coverage for other modules
   - All critical paths covered by integration tests
   - All user-facing features covered by end-to-end tests

3. **Performance**
   - No regressions in model loading time
   - No regressions in inference speed
   - Search operations must complete within 200ms for average projects
   - Web interface must load within 2 seconds

4. **Documentation**
   - All modules documented with clear purpose and usage examples
   - API endpoints documented with request/response formats
   - Updated user guide reflecting new features and changes

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Commit Frequency**: Commit after completing each task or subtask
- **Branch Strategy**: Each phase should be developed in its own branch
- **Code Reviews**: Required for all PRs before merging
- **Validation**: Each task must be validated against criteria before being marked complete
- **Dependency Management**: Use explicit imports and avoid circular dependencies
- **Error Handling**: All functions should handle errors gracefully and provide clear messages

## Important Reminders

1. **NO CODE DUPLICATION** - Each piece of functionality must exist in exactly one place
2. **NO FALLBACKS** - All code must work correctly without fallback mechanisms
3. **NO LEGACY SUPPORT** - Old implementations must be completely replaced
4. **CLEAN ARCHITECTURE** - Maintain proper separation of concerns
5. **THOROUGH TESTING** - All code must be thoroughly tested
6. **KEEP IT SIMPLE** - Choose the simplest implementation that meets requirements
