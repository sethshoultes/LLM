# RAG UI Implementation Taskmaster

**Reference Document**: [RAG_UI_IMPROVEMENTS_PRD.md](/Volumes/LLM/docs/PRD/COMPLETE/RAG/RAG_UI_IMPROVEMENTS_PRD.md)

## Core Principles (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Zero code duplication. Each functionality must exist in exactly one place.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Implement the simplest solution that works. No unnecessary complexity.
- **Clean File System**: All replaced or duplicate files MUST be removed. No orphaned, redundant, or unused files.
- **No Fallbacks**: No legacy code support or fallback mechanisms that mask issues.
- **Single Implementation**: Each feature has exactly one implementation. No alternative implementations allowed.
- **Clean Implementation**: No commented-out code, no TODOs in production, no "we'll fix it later" code.
