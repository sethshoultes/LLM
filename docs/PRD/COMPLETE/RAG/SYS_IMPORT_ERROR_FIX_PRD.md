# System Import Error Fix PRD

## Issue Summary

When attempting to generate a response with the TinyLlama model, the following error occurs:

```
ERROR:llm_interface:[Generating response for model LLM-MODELS/quantized/gguf/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q4_K_M.gguf] Error: UnboundLocalError - cannot access local variable 'sys' where it is not associated with a value
```

This error occurs in `quiet_interface.py` during the model inference process within the `/api/chat` endpoint handler. The code attempts to use the `sys` module within a local function scope, but doesn't properly ensure it's accessible.

## Root Cause Analysis

In `quiet_interface.py` around line 1141-1146 in the `do_POST` handler for the `/api/chat` endpoint, there's code that uses the `sys` module:

```python
try:
    sys.path.append(str(BASE_DIR / "scripts"))
    # Make sure the scripts directory is in the path
    scripts_dir = str(BASE_DIR / "scripts")
    if scripts_dir not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(scripts_dir)
                
    import minimal_inference_quiet as minimal_inference
    # ...
```

While `sys` is imported at the top of the file (line 5), Python's scoping rules can cause variables to be treated as local if they are assigned to within a function, even if they're also defined in the global scope. When there's an error in this section, Python might treat `sys` as a local variable if it's redefined or shadowed somewhere in the function.

## Solution Requirements

1. Ensure the `sys` module is properly accessible throughout the code, particularly in error handling sections
2. Fix the scoping issue without introducing unnecessary code duplications
3. Adhere to the core principles:
   - DRY: Don't repeat imports
   - KISS: Keep the solution simple
   - Transparent Error Handling: Ensure errors are properly displayed
   - Clean Implementation: Use proper Python scoping practices

## Implementation Approach

The solution will:

1. Identify any places where `sys` is being shadowed or redefined in local scopes
2. Ensure the global `sys` module is properly accessible where needed
3. Add explicit imports in function scopes where required, following the pattern used for other modules
4. Fix any other related scoping issues in the codebase

## Success Criteria

1. The `UnboundLocalError` related to the `sys` variable no longer occurs when generating responses
2. The error handling code properly displays actual errors to users rather than scoping errors
3. All models work correctly, especially TinyLlama which was exhibiting the issue
4. The solution follows the code style guidelines specified in CLAUDE.md

## Implementation Plan

1. Examine the error handlers and API endpoints in `quiet_interface.py` to find where `sys` is used
2. Add explicit imports or fix scoping issues for the `sys` module where necessary
3. Test with TinyLlama model specifically to ensure the error is resolved
4. Verify all other models continue to work correctly
5. Ensure proper error messages are displayed to users

## Compatibility

This change is backwards compatible and won't affect any other functionality. It's a bug fix that addresses only a scoping issue in the Python code.
