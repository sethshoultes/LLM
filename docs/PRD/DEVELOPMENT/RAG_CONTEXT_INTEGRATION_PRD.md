# PRD: RAG Context Integration Improvement

## Problem Statement
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system shows warning-free operation but fails to properly integrate document context into model responses. When users add documents with specific information, the LLM ignores this context in its responses, rendering the RAG functionality ineffective.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Context Integration Failure**: While documents appear to load correctly, the system fails to properly inject context into prompts, or the context is being formatted incorrectly
2. **Embedding Quality Issues**: Our fallback embedding model uses random vectors without semantic meaning
3. **Context Flow**: There may be disconnects in the data flow between document retrieval and prompt construction
4. **System Architecture**: The hybrid_search module is properly imported but not effectively utilized

## Solution Requirements

### Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)
- **DRY**: No duplicate code or files
- **KISS**: Simplest effective implementation
- **Zero Fallbacks**: No error masking or fallback mechanisms
- **Clean File Structure**: Remove all unused or duplicate files
- **Transparent Errors**: All errors must be clearly displayed

### Technical Requirements
1. Implement proper context injection in the prompt creation workflow
2. Replace random vector fallback with deterministic text-based embedding
3. Ensure context flows properly between document retrieval and LLM generation
4. Establish clear logging for context integration
5. Remove any duplicate/unused code throughout the RAG system

## Task List

1. **Investigation Phase**
   - [x] Trace the complete data flow from document loading to prompt construction
   - [x] Identify exact point where context is lost or malformed
   - [x] Test hybrid_search with direct API calls to verify functionality
   - [x] Audit all files to identify duplicates or obsolete code

2. **Core Fix Implementation**
   - [x] Modify context integration in minimal_inference_quiet.py
   - [x] Improve deterministic fallback vector generation in hybrid_search.py
   - [x] Fix any malformed prompt templates affecting context integration
   - [x] Add comprehensive logging of context inclusion in prompts

3. **System Cleanup**
   - [x] Remove all duplicate files and consolidate functionality
   - [x] Eliminate any unused imports and dead code
   - [x] Standardize error handling across the codebase
   - [x] Ensure proper initialization order for all components

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - [x] Create specific test cases with known context information
   - [x] Validate context integration with various document types
   - [x] Test cross-component communication in RAG system
   - [x] Verify performance with both small and large context documents

5. **Documentation & Integration**
   - [x] Update user documentation for RAG functionality
   - [x] Document technical architecture and data flow
   - [x] Ensure consistent component naming and interfaces

## Success Criteria
1. Model responses incorporate information from context documents 100% of the time
2. System loads and processes context without warnings or errors
3. No duplicate or unnecessary files exist in the codebase
4. RAG functionality works properly when using both keyword and semantic search

## Implementation Notes
- All changes must align with the established DRY/KISS protocols
- No fallbacks, no legacy code support, and no duplicate files allowed
- The product must function cleanly out of the box
- Progress must be tracked and updated regularly

## Implementation Summary

The following key changes were made to fix the RAG context integration issues:

1. **Fixed Context Integration in API Extensions**
   - Correctly passed system_prompt from context manager to inference module
   - Isolated message history to prevent leakage between chats
   - Added detailed debug logging for context integration

2. **Improved Prompt Formatting in Minimal Inference**
   - Corrected Mistral model prompt format to include `<s>` token
   - Added system prompt logging for debugging purposes
   - Fixed conversation history formatting for consistency

3. **Enhanced Hybrid Search Embedding**
   - Implemented a deterministic embedding fallback using character n-grams
   - Added position-aware and TF-IDF inspired weighting for better relevance
   - Improved vector normalization and caching

4. **Added Cache Management**
   - Created a clear_caches.py utility for clearing various caches
   - Added a convenient clear_caches.sh script for easy cache cleaning
   - Updated documentation with troubleshooting instructions

5. **Documentation and Testing**
   - Updated RAG_USAGE.md with troubleshooting section
   - Created test_rag_context.py for verification of context integration
   - Added detailed comments and logging throughout the codebase

The implementation follows all core principles:
- DRY: No duplicate code or redundant implementations
- KISS: Simple, straightforward solutions without over-engineering
- Clean File System: No unnecessary or unused files
- Transparent Error Handling: Clear error reporting with proper logging
